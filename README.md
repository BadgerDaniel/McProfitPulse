UNFINISHED PROJECT 



See McData_Readme




Notes for later documentation:

Key Points for Documentation:
Project Overview: Begin with a concise summary of the project's objectives, emphasizing the aim to provide dynamic and interactive visualizations for exploring cost, profit, and sales data.

Tool Selection and Rationale: Discuss why Plotly (and potentially Dash) was chosen for the project, highlighting its capabilities for creating interactive, aesthetically pleasing visualizations that are easy to share and deploy.

Implementation Strategy:

Detail the step-by-step process of developing the visualizations, from initial creation in a Jupyter notebook to potential deployment using Dash or Streamlit.
Include information on how users can input data and interact with the visualizations, focusing on the customization of cost values and the real-time update of visualizations.
Deployment Options: Provide guidance on how to share the visualizations as standalone HTML files or deploy them as a web application, including platform suggestions like Heroku, AWS, or Streamlit Sharing.

User Guide: Include a section on how to use the tool, with screenshots and examples of the interactive features, such as hovering for more details and adjusting input parameters.

Technical Details:

Offer a comprehensive explanation of the code, including data manipulation, aggregation, and visualization creation, with code snippets and commentary.
Discuss data cleaning, preprocessing steps, and the rationale behind certain coding decisions, especially those related to handling missing data or transforming the dataset.
Data Science Concepts: Explain the data science techniques and concepts applied in the project, such as exploratory data analysis, feature scaling, and the use of interactive dashboards for data visualization.

Troubleshooting and FAQs: Provide solutions to common issues users might encounter, especially related to data input, visualization rendering, or deployment challenges.

Future Development: Outline potential future enhancements, such as adding more interactive elements, integrating additional datasets, or expanding the deployment options.

This structured approach to the documentation will ensure clarity, ease of use, and transferability of the project, allowing others to understand, contribute to, or further develop the tool as needed.
